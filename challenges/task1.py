# A company has a list of expected revenues and payments for the upcoming
# year in chronological order. The problem is that at some moments in time
# the sum of previous payments can be larger than the total previous revenue.
# This would put the company in debt. To avoid this problem the company
# takes a very simple approach. It reschedules some expenses to the end of
# the year.

# You are given an array of integers, where positive numbers represent
# revenues and negative numbers represent expenses, all in chronological
# order. In one move you can relocate any expense (negative number) to the
# end of the array. What is the minimum number of such relocations to make
# sure that the company never falls into debt? In other words: you need to
# make sure that there is no consecutive sequence of elements starting from
# the beginning of the array, that sums up to a negative number.
# You can assume that the sum of all elements in A is nonnegative.

# Write a function:
# def solution(A)
# that, given an array A of N integers, returns the minimum number of
# relocations, so that company never falls into debt.

# Examples:
# 1. Given A = [1 0, -10, -1, -1, 10], the function should return 1. It is enough to
# move -10 to the end of the array.
# 2. Given A = [-1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the function should return 3. The negative
# elements at the beginning must be moved to the end to avoid debt at the
# start of the year.
# 3. Given A = [5, -2, -3, 1], the function should return 0. The company balance
# is always nonnegative.


def solution(A):
    balance = 0
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(A) - 1):
        future_balance = balance + A[i] + A[i + 1]
        if A[i] == 0:
            pass
        elif balance + A[i] < 0:
            counter += 1
            continue
        elif future_balance < 0:
            i += 1
            counter += 1
            continue
        balance += A[i]
    return counter
